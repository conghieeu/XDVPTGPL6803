Unity Version: 2021.2.10f1

# About
A pixel-style top-down survival game that can later transform into a strategic city-building game.

### Survival
It is supposed to have a focus on the survival aspect, which includes farming, gathering, fighting, exploring, as well as self-development.

### CityBuild
After the extensive survival aspect, the player will be able to move into a city build, where the player can interact with NPCs, build their city, automate production, and be involved in cross-city interactions (war, trade, alliances).

# Current Status
The main focus right now is on the survival aspect and the CityBuild is planned after the survival aspect is finished.
